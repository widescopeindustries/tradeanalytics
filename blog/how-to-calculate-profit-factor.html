            <h1>How to Calculate Profit Factor (And Why It Matters More Than Win Rate)</h1>
            <p class="meta">January 29, 2026 · 6 min read · Trading Metrics</p>

            <p>Every new trader obsesses over win rate. "I won 70% of my trades!" sounds impressive — until you realize those wins averaged $50 and the losses averaged $200.</p>

            <p>That's why professional traders focus on <strong>profit factor</strong> instead. It tells you the full story.</p>

            <h2>What Is Profit Factor?</h2>
            <p>Profit factor is the ratio of your gross profits to your gross losses. It answers a simple question: <em>for every dollar you lose, how many dollars do you make back?</em></p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <code>Profit Factor = Gross Profits ÷ Gross Losses</code>
            </div>

            <p>A profit factor above 1.0 means you're profitable. Below 1.0 means you're losing money.</p>

            <h2>How to Calculate Profit Factor: Step by Step</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Add up all your winning trades.</strong> If you had 3 winners of $100, $150, and $75, your gross profit is $325.</li>
                <li><strong>Add up all your losing trades.</strong> If you had 2 losers of $80 and $120, your gross loss is $200.</li>
                <li><strong>Divide profits by losses.</strong> $325 ÷ $200 = 1.625 profit factor.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>What's a Good Profit Factor?</h2>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Profit Factor</th>
                    <th>Rating</th>
                    <th>What It Means</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Below 1.0</td>
                    <td>❌ Losing</td>
                    <td>You're losing money overall</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.0 – 1.25</td>
                    <td>⚠️ Break-even</td>
                    <td>Barely profitable after fees</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.25 – 1.75</td>
                    <td>✅ Good</td>
                    <td>Solid, sustainable edge</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.75 – 2.5</td>
                    <td>🔥 Excellent</td>
                    <td>Strong trading system</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Above 2.5</td>
                    <td>🚀 Elite</td>
                    <td>Either exceptional or small sample size</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Most consistently profitable traders have a profit factor between 1.3 and 2.0. If yours is above 3.0, make sure you have enough trades (100+) to validate it.</p>

            <h2>Why Profit Factor Beats Win Rate</h2>
            <p>Consider two traders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trader A:</strong> 80% win rate, avg win $40, avg loss $150. Profit factor: 0.67</li>
                <li><strong>Trader B:</strong> 40% win rate, avg win $300, avg loss $75. Profit factor: 2.67</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Trader A wins most trades but loses money. Trader B loses most trades but makes serious profit. Win rate is meaningless without context.</p>

            <h2>How to Improve Your Profit Factor</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cut losers faster.</strong> Reduce average loss by using tighter stops or exiting at first sign of trouble.</li>
                <li><strong>Let winners run.</strong> Increase average win by using trailing stops instead of fixed targets.</li>
                <li><strong>Filter low-quality setups.</strong> Some setups have better profit factors than others. Find yours.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze by time of day.</strong> Your profit factor at 10am might be 2.0 while at 2pm it's 0.8.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>Stop chasing high win rates. A 40% win rate with great risk/reward beats a 70% win rate with poor risk/reward every time.</p>
            <p>Track your profit factor. Optimize for it. That's how professionals trade.</p>
