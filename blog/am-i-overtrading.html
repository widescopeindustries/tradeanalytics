            <h1>Am I Overtrading? 5 Signs You're Taking Too Many Trades</h1>
            <p class="meta">January 29, 2026 · 6 min read · Trading Psychology</p>

            <p>Overtrading is the silent killer of trading accounts. It's not dramatic like a single blown trade — it's death by a thousand cuts. Commissions, spreads, bad fills, and emotional fatigue slowly drain your account while you convince yourself you're "staying active."</p>

            <p>Here are 5 data-driven signs that you're overtrading — and what to do about it.</p>

            <h2>Sign #1: Your Win Rate Drops After Trade #3</h2>
            <p>Look at your performance by trade sequence each day. Your first 2-3 trades often have a higher win rate than trades 4, 5, 6+.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Early trades are planned. Later trades are often forced — either chasing, revenge trading, or fighting boredom.</p>
            <p><strong>Check your data:</strong> Compare win rate and profit factor for first 3 trades vs all trades after. If there's a big drop, you have your answer.</p>

            <h2>Sign #2: You Trade More on Losing Days</h2>
            <p>Count your trades on green days vs red days. If you're taking significantly more trades on losing days, you're revenge trading.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Red flag:</strong> If your losing days have 50%+ more trades than your winning days, overtrading is actively destroying your account.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Losses trigger the urge to "make it back." Each trade digs the hole deeper.</p>

            <h2>Sign #3: Your P&L Per Trade is Declining</h2>
            <p>Calculate your average P&L per trade. If it's shrinking over time (or barely covers commissions), you're diluting your edge with low-quality trades.</p>
            <p><strong>The math:</strong> If your edge is $15/trade on quality setups, but you're averaging $3/trade overall, you're taking too many marginal trades.</p>
            <p><strong>Check your data:</strong> Rank your trades by quality (if you track setups) or by profit. Your top 50% of trades likely account for 100%+ of your profits.</p>

            <h2>Sign #4: You Trade During "Dead" Hours</h2>
            <p>Look at when you're trading. If you're active during lunch hours (11am-2pm) or late in the day when you're tired, you're probably forcing it.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Boredom. FOMO. The need to feel productive. None of these are good reasons to trade.</p>
            <p><strong>Check your data:</strong> Calculate profit factor by hour. If certain hours are below 1.0, you're literally paying to trade during those times.</p>

            <h2>Sign #5: Your Commissions Are a Significant % of P&L</h2>
            <p>Add up your total commissions and compare to your gross P&L. If commissions are eating more than 20% of gross profits, you're trading too much.</p>
            <p><strong>The math:</strong> 100 trades at $1 commission = $100. If your gross profit is $400, commissions took 25%. That's too high.</p>
            <p><strong>Elite traders:</strong> Often keep commissions under 10% of gross by being selective.</p>

            <h2>How to Fix Overtrading</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set a daily trade limit.</strong> Start with 3 trades max. Increase only if you're consistently profitable.</li>
                <li><strong>Define your A+ setups.</strong> If it's not an A+ setup, don't take it. Period.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop after 2 consecutive losses.</strong> Walk away for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Track trade quality.</strong> Rate each trade 1-5 before you enter. Only take 4s and 5s.</li>
                <li><strong>Review your data weekly.</strong> Know your numbers. They don't lie.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>The best traders trade <em>less</em>, not more. They wait for high-probability setups and ignore everything else.</p>
            <p>If you're asking "am I overtrading?" — you probably are. Let the data confirm it, then fix it.</p>
