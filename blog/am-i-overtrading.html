            <p>Overtrading is the silent killer of trading accounts. It's not dramatic like a single blown trade — it's death by a thousand cuts.</p>

            <h2>Sign #1: Your Win Rate Drops After Trade #3</h2>
            <p>Look at your performance by trade sequence each day. Your first 2-3 trades often have a higher win rate than trades 4, 5, 6+.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Early trades are planned. Later trades are often forced.</p>

            <h2>Sign #2: You Trade More on Losing Days</h2>
            <p>Count your trades on green days vs red days. If you're taking significantly more trades on losing days, you're revenge trading.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Red flag:</strong> If your losing days have 50%+ more trades than your winning days, overtrading is actively destroying your account.
            </div>

            <h2>Sign #3: Your P&L Per Trade is Declining</h2>
            <p>Calculate your average P&L per trade. If it's shrinking over time, you're diluting your edge with low-quality trades.</p>

            <h2>Sign #4: You Trade During "Dead" Hours</h2>
            <p>Look at when you're trading. If you're active during lunch hours or late in the day when you're tired, you're probably forcing it.</p>

            <h2>Sign #5: Your Commissions Are a Significant % of P&L</h2>
            <p>Add up your total commissions and compare to your gross P&L. If commissions are eating more than 20% of gross profits, you're trading too much.</p>

            <h2>How to Fix Overtrading</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set a daily trade limit.</strong> Start with 3 trades max.</li>
                <li><strong>Define your A+ setups.</strong> If it's not A+, don't take it.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop after 2 consecutive losses.</strong> Walk away for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Track trade quality.</strong> Rate each trade 1-5 before you enter.</li>
                <li><strong>Review your data weekly.</strong> Know your numbers.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>The best traders trade <em>less</em>, not more. They wait for high-probability setups and ignore everything else.</p>
